# Woohoo!
# Your designer is using Gemba to add and update assets all by themselves. Gemba also
# catches common problems before they reach you, like invalid or mismatched dimensions.
# 
# This YAML file configures this repo for Gemba. Push changes to this file, and
# your designers will use your updated config next time they launch Gemba.
